Online-CSR-Generator is a pretty simple PHP Webapp which generates Certificate Signing Request ( CSR ) for creating SSL certificates.

This PHP Webapp is just designed for make it much easier instead of doing it with OpenSSL via the command line interface.

After generating CSR, both of your CSR and private key will be sent to Vault.
